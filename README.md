# GeetingandCleaningData_FinalProject
This repository will be used to store my delivery for the final project of the Geeting and Cleaning Data Module.

The aim of the project is to deploy a piece of code which does the following (quote to the request from coursera's task):

    Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
